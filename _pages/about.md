I am an assistant professor in [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat.utexas.edu/) (SDS) at the University of Texas at Austin. Previously, I was a [Data Science Fellow](https://midas.umich.edu/fellows/) at the Michigan Institute for Data Science ([MIDAS](https://midas.umich.edu/)) and received my Ph.D. in physics and scientific computing from the University of Michigan. My research contributes to the fields of astroinformatics and urban informatics; and is focused on understanding and mitigating the unexpected and not-well understood consequences of AI models, including algorithmic bias and uncertainty quantification. I was a Schmidt Science Fellow finalist, recipient of the best student paper award in KDDâ€™18, and recipient of >$500k grant funding. 

I am currently leading three research teams. I am co-director of [Urban Information Lab](https://soa.utexas.edu/node/7701) at UT-Austin, where our team integrates emerging technologies, methods, and data science to analyze urban problems. [Danai Koutra](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dkoutra/) and I co-founded the Data-Informed Cities for Everyone (DICE) community, a multi-institutional research collaboration that uses data to inform budget planning, resource allocation, and policy evaluation in urban settings. I am also in the leadership team of Baryon Pasters (BP). BP is an international research team that designs and deploys computational and algorithmic solutions to problems in modern survey astronomy. Besides science, I am interested in implementing novel educational models to engage with students. With my colleagues at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu/), I built the first data science "Service learning" program. Last but not least, I am an active member of the ``data science for social good`` community, a growing community of data scientists that AI solutions to change society by enhancing equitable access to resources meaningfully. I am an active member of several international projects and collaborations, including [HETDEX](https://hetdex.org/), the Dark Energy Survey([DES](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/)), the COsmostatistics INitiative ([COIN](https://cosmostatistics-initiative.org/)), and [XMM-XXL](http://irfu.cea.fr/xxl) Consortium, among others. I am also a Statistics Without Borders ([SWB](https://swb.wildapricot.org/)) volunteer. 

**World Economic Forum Report**: I contributed to [a report from the World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/reports/digitizing-and-transforming-mobility-systems-lessons-from-the-detroit-region) featuring a data science project co-funded by MIDAS, U-M Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI), U-M College of Engineering and the Knight Foundation. The project is part of a larger Seamless Integrated Mobility effort that aims to transform mobility systems in Detroit, Ann Arbor, and Windsor, MI. The project is one example of how data science can make a significant impact on policymaking. 

**Undergraduate/graduate students**: Our team is growing, and I am actively recruiting both graduate and undergraduate students. I am continually looking for dedicated students at the University of Texas at Austin (*you*) who are interested in data science with social impact or astronomy projects. These projects involve a balance of theoretical, methodological, and data analysis work. Experience in theoretical physics, astronomy, statistics, or computer science is a plus but not a requirement. If you are looking for a project, please read [FAQs](https://afarahi.github.io/lab-team/) here and then send me an email.


General Research Interest
------
My general research interest goes beyond what I am currently focused on. Here is a non-exhaustive list of my research interests:


**Main Research**

- Urban informatics -- AI-support systems for decision-making and resource allocation tasks 
- Astroinformatics -- Data-driven and machine learning solutions for problems in astronomy 
- Computation -- Computational and approximate methods in statistical inference 
- Methodology -- Fair and trustworthy AI systems in uncertain settings 
  - Algorithmic fairness, identifying and mitigating data and algorithmic bias 
  - Uncertainty quantification in machine learning models 
  

**Data Science for Social Good**

- data-driven public policy and decision making,
- service-learning,
- education, and public outreach.

**Miscellaneous** 

- topological and statistical properties of random fields,
- network theory and its application,
- non-perturbative methods.
