            <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Health Equity in AI Decision (HEAD) aims to revolutionize our approach to public health and healthcare technology access disparities. By focusing primarily on the United States and the United Kingdom, HEAD is committed to identifying and addressing the root causes of these disparities through a collaborative research initiative. Our goal is to create a community and establish a new benchmark for analyzing and transforming healthcare technology and public health worldwide.</span>

The primary objective is to drive advancements in public health and healthcare technology by creating and growing our HEAD community and developing targeted research programs. We aim to empower policymakers, healthcare professionals, and social justice advocates to pinpoint and tackle disparities across different populations and locations, informed by ethically driven technologies. Ultimately, </span>

            <span style="font-weight: 400;"> The one-week residency program is designed to be the key driver in establishing the HEAD core team. This immersive experience will bring together approximately 15 individuals from various sectors—including research, government, and the private sector—to collaborate in a unique co-working and co-living environment. Participants will forge meaningful professional and intellectual connections while addressing some of the community's most pressing challenges. </span>The program will be from July 12th to July 19th.</b>
          <br>
          <br><b>Program Structure and Philosophy. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The essence of the residency program lies in its deliberately unstructured format, designed to stimulate organic development of project ideas among participants. This approach allows for a free-flowing exchange of knowledge and perspectives, fostering an atmosphere where innovative solutions can emerge naturally from collaborative efforts. Participants are encouraged to engage with one another, exploring new concepts and methodologies that cross the traditional boundaries of their respective fields.</span>&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">HEAD Residency Program is an semi-structured meeting that offers opportunities for collaborative research, learning, and skills transfer. It is composed of early career and senior researchers from health sciences, statistics, computer science, and related disciplines alike. The group utilizes a management model somewhat similar to technological start-ups. Our dynamic, non-hierarchical, and people-centric approach enables innovation in scientific research while helping its members enhance their career paths.</span>&nbsp;<br>
            <br>Project Development. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The primary aim of this residency is to conceptualize and initiate two to three projects that the HEAD community will champion over the following year. These projects are expected to tackle significant challenges at the intersection of healthcare technology access and public health equity. By the program's conclusion, participants will have formed dedicated teams around these projects, laying the groundwork for continued collaboration and research.</span>
            <br>
            <br>Workshops and Activities. <span style="font-weight: 400;">While the program thrives on its semi-structured nature, it is augmented by a few carefully selected workshops aimed at providing participants with shared frameworks and tools that can enhance their collaborative efforts. These workshops cover topics such as RRI practices, ethical considerations in healthcare technology, and innovative research methodologies. The rest of the time, participants are encouraged to self-organize, self-cater, and engage in discussions, brainstorming sessions, and preliminary project development work in an informal setting. We provide your accommodation i.e. one bedroom and access to common-area facilities for the length of the residency. Drinks and light snacks will be available in the kitchen and dining room.</span>
            <br>
            <br>Expected Outcomes. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The residency program's success will be measured by the quality and potential impact of the projects it incubates. By fostering an environment where participants can freely share ideas and expertise, the program aims to produce research initiatives that address critical gaps in healthcare technology and public health. Moreover, the relationships and networks formed during this week are expected to extend beyond the program, contributing to a sustained effort toward achieving HEAD's long-term goals.</span>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2" spellcheck="false">HEAD is composed of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. This is one of the characteristics which makes it unique and fruitful.We require participants to follow these guidelines which help steer our interactions and strive to keep the ​residency programs an enlightening experience for all members involved.<br>
          <br>The official language of the residency program is English<br>
          <br>Residency program will be a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality or religion.Please bring any issues to the confidential attention of the workshop organizers.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Directives:</span>
          <br>Be receptive to constructive comment and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts.<br>
          <br>Be thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times the labour was completed simply for the good of the group.<br>
          <br>Be good and respectful to each other.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Given the informal nature of the program, be perceptive about eventual help needed in the organization and maintenance of the household tasks. Remember that there is no room service or catering. Keeping things clean and organized is up to the group itself.<br>
          <br> Residency program is a strictly non-smoking event. Smoking is not allowed anywhere inside the venue.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Participants sharing a room should pay attention to tidiness, personal hygiene, sleeping hours and noise. In the common areas, there is no time limit and you can keep working through the night, if you wish to.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Publication and authorship:</span>
          <br>The mere participation in one of the ​residency program&nbsp;does not&nbsp;guarantee authorship in HEAD papers. Publications developed during the ​residency programs are lead by volunteer participants who commit to the implementation of all stages of the project during and after the meeting. All participants who contribute to development of a project will be included in the author list. The order of the authors is decided by the project leader, in common agreement with the HEAD chairs, once the paper is finalized.<br>
